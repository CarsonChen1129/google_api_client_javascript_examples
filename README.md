Google API Javascript Examples

Some of the Google APIs do not have examples for Javascript (such as Google Calendar), I wrote those functions in Javascript using the callback method. It might have asynchronization issue, please feel free to use it directly for a single call or you might need to add promises to solve the async problems.

Enjoy~ :)
